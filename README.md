# Calculator
ðŸš€ Built a Dynamic Calculator Using JavaScript!

Just completed a JavaScript-based Calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean and intuitive UI. This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

âœ… DOM Manipulation
âœ… Event Handling
âœ… JavaScript Functions & Logic
âœ… Responsive UI Design

It's a simple yet effective project that strengthens core JavaScript skills. Check it out [if you have a link]! Would love to hear your feedback! ðŸ’¡ðŸ”¥
